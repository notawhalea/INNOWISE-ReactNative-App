Pokemon application testing task for **Innowise**:sunglasses:

It's my *solution* of these task. Here i learn and gained experience in working with React Native:blue_heart:

**What I've done**:question:
**********
**Instructions**

Create a simple application to view *pokemons*.

Minimal functionality::exclamation:

* List should display pokemon names from [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon).
List should support pagination.
* When a user clicks on cell, then the details screen is opened.
* The Pokemon details page will use the API [PokeApi](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/{id}/)
and show the next information:
* The Pokemon's name
* A single image of the pokemon from the front (found under sprites )
* The Pokemon's "types" e.g. grass
* The Pokemon's weight in kg
* The Pokemon's height in cm
* The page should also have some form of back button to go back to the
Pokemon list.
* Make sure you consider and handle all possible states of the app (offline, data
not loading, errors, etc).
* Data should be cached in the database to support offline mode.
Requirements:
* Clean Architecture / VIPER
* Use your own design for the application
* Code should support Unit-testing
**********
**Result:**:ok_hand:

* Code should be pushed to a public repository on GitHub
* Repository should contains commit history instead of a single one
* Select icons by yourself. App should contain non-default launch icon
* Link should be provided to interviewe
